Serial Communication
--------------------

The serial communication is possible with the USB port
of the Arduino Uno or with the RX/TX pins of the
controller.

It is possible to debug the light sculpture. Each LED
can be tested. If it is currently on the PWM control
may be defective and if it is currently off than the LED
or the current source may be defective.
